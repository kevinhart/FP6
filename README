SExpr.hs contains code pertaining to the SExpr data type.  That is: alpha,
unalpha, beta, and the Show and Read implementations.  Macros.hs contains the
implementation of substitute and the Macros type.

Testing.hs imports both modules.  It also contains several lists of strings
representing lambda expressions and macros from homework 2.  The testresult
function takes a list of strings representing SExpr String and reads them,
substitutes all the macros, and runs beta on each of them.
